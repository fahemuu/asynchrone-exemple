    <h2>Asynchrone exemples</h2>
    <p>
        Each sample file is included every 1.5 seconds in HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
        So each file is played over a 1.5 second interval to gain readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each file uses the same principle: make a get on a json.
    </p>
    <p>
        But each file includes a different method.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are played in the following order:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li id="callback">callback.js -> ES5 callback usage</li>
        <li id="promise">promise.js -> ES2015 promise usage</li>
        <li id="asyncAwait">asyncAwait.js -> ES2017 async/await usage</li>
        <li id="gofurther">gofurther.js -> all & race Promise methods</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="title">Now you can open the console to see the results or you can reload the page to replay the scripts
         (And see live results with the console open).</h2>
